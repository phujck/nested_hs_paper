# NHS-NCNG-1

## Model
- Same non-commuting qutrit as NHS-NCG-1.
- Exact static spin-field trace-out:
  `rho_S^ED = sum_B p(B) e^{-beta(H_S+Bf)}/Tr[...]`.

## Predictions
- K2-only reconstruction.
- K2+K4 reconstruction.

## What is plotted
- Overlay of ED, K2, K2+K4 for representative `p0(coupling)`.
- Improvement map `D_K2 / D_K2+K4` in `(beta,coupling)` plane.
