\section{\label{sec:discussion}Discussion}

This V2 manuscript isolates the commuting sector and enforces direct reference/prediction overlays against exact finite-bath trace-outs. Two points are established:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Gaussian commuting benchmark is quantitatively controlled by cutoff convergence and HS sampling checks.
\item In the non-Gaussian commuting benchmark, higher cumulants extracted from the bath partition function act as genuine renormalisation corrections and improve agreement with ED over the sampled grid.
\end{enumerate}

The non-commuting sector, where operator growth and ordering effects become central, is deferred to the final paper in this project line. The present scope is deliberately narrower: commuting-only, with explicit model definitions, transparent numerical implementation, and quantitative claim gates.
