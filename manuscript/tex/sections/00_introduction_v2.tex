\section{\label{sec:intro}Introduction}

The Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) is the effective operator whose Gibbs form reproduces the reduced equilibrium state of a strongly coupled open quantum system~\cite{campisiFluctuationTheoremArbitrary2009,talknerColloquiumStatisticalMechanics2020,trushechkinOpenQuantumSystem2022,seifertFirstSecondLaw2016}. For
\(
H=H_S+H_B+f\otimes B
\),
one defines
\(
\bar\rho_S=\Tr_B e^{-\beta H}
\)
and
\(
e^{-\beta H_{\mathrm{MF}}}=\bar\rho_S/Z_B
\).
In Gaussian settings, HS decoupling of the influence kernel is standard; in non-Gaussian settings, higher connected cumulants appear and the single-field HS picture is insufficient.

The central technical point of this work is that each even-order cumulant contribution can be rewritten as a quadratic form in a composite field and therefore decoupled by a Gaussian auxiliary field at that level. This yields a nested HS hierarchy that is exact order-by-order.

This V2 manuscript focuses strictly on the commuting sector, $[H_S,f]=0$, where the hierarchy collapses to scalar cumulant coefficients and produces a polynomial HMF:
\begin{equation}
H_{\mathrm{MF}}=H_S-\sum_{n\ge 1}\alpha_{2n}f^{2n}+\mathrm{const}.
\end{equation}
The coefficients are extracted from a source-deformed bath partition function, enabling direct finite-bath benchmarking.

Numerically, we use four commuting tests with exact reduced-state references:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a multi-qubit magnetisation-sector benchmark (including non-PSD quartic branch) with exact sector law and HS Monte Carlo overlays;
\item a qutrit clock phase benchmark for complex-quartic phase handling under functional HS sampling;
\item a Gaussian qutrit benchmark with bosonic finite-mode ED and HS overlays;
\item a non-Gaussian qutrit benchmark with a finite transverse-spin bath, tested via truncation ladders $K_2$, $K_2{+}K_4$, and $K_2{+}K_4{+}K_6$.
\end{enumerate}

The non-commuting sector is intentionally deferred to the final paper in this project sequence.
